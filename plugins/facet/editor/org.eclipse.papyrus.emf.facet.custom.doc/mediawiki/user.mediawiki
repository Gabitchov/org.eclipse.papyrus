EMF Facet provides a '''customization''' component, that can be used to define the appearance of model elements when viewed in an editor or view that supports this customization mechanism.

== Description ==
A customization is defined in a model that conforms to the EMF Facet customization metamodel. This model is saved in a file with the ".custom" file extension.

== Customization Metamodel ==

=== customizations ===

A '''Customization''' is a '''FacetSet''': 

[[Image:../img/CustomizationMetaclass.png]]

A '''Customization''' can contain customizations for Ecore metaclasses ('''EClassCustomization'''), or Facets ('''FacetCustomization'''). Both '''EClassCustomization''' and '''FacetCustomization''' are Facets.

The '''extendedMetaclass''' of an '''EClassCustomization''' is the EClass whose instances will be customized.

The '''extendedFacet''' of an '''EClassCustomization''' or '''FacetCustomization''' is the Facet that defines the customizable features (label, color, etc.) that will be customized.

In case of facet customization, the '''customizedFacet''' of a '''FacetCustomization''' is the Facet for which model elements that conform to this Facet will be customized.

[[Image:../img/EClassAndFacetCustomizationMetaclasses.png]]

=== customizable features ===

Customizable features are defined in Facets as FacetOperations. For example, this FacetSet defines basic customizable features such as label, icon, etc.: <code>platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.emf.facet.custom.ui/resources/customproperties.efacet</code>

The following instance diagram shows how a Facet named '''CustomizedEObject''' is defined in ''customproperties.efacet''. Its '''extendedMetaclass''' is '''EObject''', so it can be used to customize any model element. It contains '''FacetOperations''' (of which only two are represented here). These FacetOperations define the customizable features: here the '''label''' and '''image''' for a model element. The type of each of these FacetOperations is the customized feature's type : an '''EString''' for the label and an '''Image''' for the image. 

[[Image:../img/CustomizedEObject.png]]

The operation is called each time the value of its customization is needed. For example, when displaying a model element in a viewer, we will need its label. So the '''label''' operation will be called on the model element for which the label is needed.

=== customization override ===
A FacetOperation that defines a customizable feature such as label, icon, color, font, etc. can be compared to a virtual method: it is meant to be overridden in extending Facets in order to provide a specific customization.

To understand this override mechanism, remember that a '''EClassCustomization''' and '''FacetCustomization''' are '''Facets''' (the '''EClassCustomization''' and '''FacetCustomization''' metaclasses extend the '''Facet''' metaclass).

==== customizing an EClass ====

To create a customization for instances of an '''EClass''': 
* create an '''EClassCustomization'''
* the new '''EClassCustomization''''s '''extendedMetaclass''' is the '''EClass''' whose instances you want to customize
* the new '''EClassCustomization''''s '''extendedFacet''' is the Facet that defines the customizable feature you want to customize (i.e. the label, color, font,...)
* you create a '''FacetOperation''' in your '''EClassCustomization''' for each customizable feature you want to customize
* each of these '''FacetOperations''' '''overrides''' the '''FacetOperation''' (from the '''extendedFacet''') corresponding to the customizable feature you want to customize
* the overriding FacetOperation and the overridden FacetOperation must have the same type
* finally, you provide an implementation for your overriding '''FacetOperation''', by the means of a '''Query''' that will return the value of the customization when this Query is evaluated on an instance of the '''extendedMetaclass'''

In the following example, we customize the label of instances of the '''Writer''' metaclass from a library metamodel (defined in ''library.ecore''). For this, we create an '''EClassCustomization''' which extends the '''CustomizedEObject''' Facet. This '''CustomizedEObject''' Facet provides the customizable feature '''label''' which we want to customize. So, we create a FacetOperation (in our EClassCustomization) which overrides the '''label''' FacetOperation (in CustomizedEObject). Finally, we choose to provide the label using a Java query, so we create a JavaQuery under our label FacetOperation's '''query''' reference. We set this JavaQuery's '''implementationClassName''' to the full qualified name of a Java class that implements the query and returns the label corresponding to a Writer instance passed as a '''source''' to this query.

==== customizing a Facet ====

To create a customization for model elements that conform to a '''Facet''': 
* create a '''FacetCustomization'''
* the new '''FacetCustomization''''s '''extendedFacet''' is the '''Facet''' whose conforming elements you want to customize
* you create a '''FacetOperation''' in your '''FacetCustomization''' for each customizable feature (label, font, color, etc.) you want to customize
* each of these '''FacetOperations''' '''overrides''' the '''FacetOperation''' corresponding to the customizable feature you want to customize
* the overriding FacetOperation and the overridden FacetOperation must have the same type
* finally, you provide an implementation for your overriding '''FacetOperation''', by the means of a '''Query''' that will return the value of the customization when this Query is evaluated on a model element that conforms to the '''extendedFacet'''

In the following example, we want to add an overlay icon on elements that conform to the '''UnproductiveWriter''' metaclass from the library FacetSet (defined in ''library.efacet''). For this, we create an '''FacetCustomization''' which extends the '''UnproductiveWriter''' Facet. We create a FacetOperation (in our FacetCustomization) which overrides the '''bottomRightOverlay''' FacetOperation that allows adding an overlay icon in the bottom right corner of an element's main icon. Finally, we provide the overlay icon using a query. This query will be evaluated with instances of '''Writer''' that conform to the '''UnproductiveWriter''' Facet, and will return the overlay icon.

=== customizing structural features ===

Each FacetOperation that defines a customizable feature has a parameter named '''eStructuralFeature'''. This parameter is useful for customizing the structural feature corresponding to a single model element. For example, in the following screenshot, a '''Library''' model element contains '''Writers''' through a structural feature named '''writers'''. If we want to customize this '''writers''' structural feature in the context of its parent '''Library''', then we need both the '''Library''' model element and the '''writers''' feature. In this case, the FacetOperation would be called on the '''Library''' model element, and the value of the '''eStructuralFeature''' parameter would be the '''writers''' feature.

=== conditional customization ===

To specify that a customization should only be applied to elements that satisfy certain criteria, you have two choices:
* Either customize a Facet that applies to elements you want to customize. This is the preferred way.
* Customize an EClass and set the '''conformanceTypedElement''' of the customization to a boolean attribute ('''EAttribute''' or '''FacetAttribute''') that returns whether the customization should be applied on the attribute's source element.

=== customization cases ===

To handle several cases in a customization (to return different values for a single customized feature depending on boolean conditions), you can implement the customized '''FacetOperation''' with an '''ETypedElementSwitchQuery'''. This type of query returns the value corresponding to the first of its cases that evaluates to '''true'''.

== Example ==
Since there is no dedicated UI tooling as yet for editing customizations, you will have to use either a generic model editor or write the XMI by hand for now. Here is an example of a customization model in the XMI format. This example defines a customization for the '''Writer''' metaclass, that customizes the label for '''Writer''' model elements. And a second customization that customizes the '''UnproductiveWriter''' Facet, to add an overlay to the icon of model elements that conform to the '''UnproductiveWriter''' Facet.

== Default Customizations ==
=== label ===
The text displayed for a model element can be customized with the '''label''' customization defined on CustomizedEObject.

=== image ===
The icon that appears before the text for a model element can be customized with the '''image''' customization defined on CustomizedEObject.

=== color ===
Both the text color ('''foreground''') and background color ('''background''') can be customized. 

=== font ===
The following font-related properties are defined on CustomizedEObject and can be customized:
* fontName
* fontSize
* isBold
* isItalic
* isUnderlined
* isStruckthrough

=== overlay ===
In addition to the main icon displayed for a model element, up to six additional ''overlay'' icons can be displayed in the corners of the main icon. The following image depicts the position of each overlay relative to the main icon:

{|style="text-align: center; border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; border-color: #000"
|[[Image:../img/topLeftOverlay.png]]
|[[Image:../img/topMiddleOverlay.png]]

|[[Image:../img/bottomMiddleOverlay.png]]
|[[Image:../img/bottomRightOverlay.png]]
|-
|bottomLeftOverlay
|bottomMiddleOverlay
|bottomRightOverlay
|}

Overlays should be defined on Facets (using a '''FacetCustomization'''). You will get a warning if you define an overlay on an EClass (with '''EClassCustomization'''). This warning may be disabled in the preferences, in section '''Model Validation > Constraints''' : check or uncheck '''EMF Facet Custom Model Validation > Avoid EClass Overlay'''.

=== obtaining customization properties ===
The default customization properties defined in EMF Facet can be obtained from the following set of interfaces:
* IContentPropertiesHandler (instantiate through IContentPropertiesHandlerFactory)
* ISelectionPropertiesHandler (instantiate through ISelectionPropertiesHandlerFactory)

== Registration ==
To make a customization available at runtime in the customization catalog, you must register it with extension point '''org.eclipse.emf.facet.util.emf.core.modeldeclaration''', like this:
<pre>
<extension point="org.eclipse.emf.facet.util.emf.core.modeldeclaration">
  <modeldeclaration file="myCustomization.custom"/>
</extension>
Also, your ".custom" file must be included in your plug-in's build.properties in order to be available in deployed plug-ins.
</pre>

== Catalog ==
Customizations that have been [[#Registration|registered]] are available from the customization catalog.
For example, if you want to retrieve the list of all registered customizations:
<pre>
ICustomizationCatalogManager customCatalog = ICustomizationCatalogManagerFactory.DEFAULT
    .getOrCreateCustomizationCatalogManager(new ResourceSetImpl());
List<Customization> allCustomizations = customCatalog.getRegisteredCustomizations();
</pre>
Then you can for example look for a customization with a given name in the previous list:
<pre>
Customization myCustom = CustomizationUtils.getCustomization(allCustomizations, "MyCustomization");
</pre>

== Customization Manager ==

The customization manager is used to manipulate customizations. To obtain an instance of the CustomizationManager, you must ask the customization manager factory:
<pre>
ICustomizationManager customManager = ICustomizationManagerFactory.DEFAULT.getOrCreateICustomizationManager(resourceSet);
</pre>
The resourceSet parameter must be the same ResourceSet that was used to instantiate a customization catalog manager in <code>ICustomizationCatalogManagerFactory#getOrCreateCustomizationCatalogManager</code>. 

The customization manager provides these important methods:
* getManagedCustomizations() : returns a modifiable list of customizations managed by this customization manager. For example, to add a customization: <code>customManager.getManagedCustomizations().add(custom);</code>
* getCustomValueOf(EObject, FacetOperation, Class) : evaluates a customization property on a given object, and returns the result. The class parameter is used to typecheck the result and return a value of the correct type. For example: <code>Boolean result = customManager.getCustomValueOf(eObject, aBooleanProperty, Boolean.class);</code>

== Customized Providers ==
You don't always have to interact with the customization manager directly though: when you want to evaluate a standard customization property (label, image, visibility, etc.), you can use a customized label or content provider supplied by EMF Facet:
* ICustomizedLabelProvider (instantiate through ICustomizedLabelProviderFactory or IResolvingCustomizedLabelProviderFactory)
* ICustomizedTreeContentProvider (instantiate through ICustomizedContentProviderFactory)
