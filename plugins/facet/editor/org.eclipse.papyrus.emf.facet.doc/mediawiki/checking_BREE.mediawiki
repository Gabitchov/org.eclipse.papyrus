One of the requirements for the simultaneous release is "All plug-ins must correctly list their Bundle Required Execution Environment (BREE)".

To satisfy this requirement, we check conformance thusly:
* Checkout all EMF Facet plug-ins in the workspace
* In the '''Problems''' view, open the view menu and select '''Configure Contents...''', and create a new configuration with:
** Scope = on any element
** Severity = Error, Warning, Info
** Text contains = "execution environment"
** Types: check all
* Rebuild the whole workspace, and check that the '''Problems''' view is empty
* Search the workspace in plain text for "JavaSE" in files named "Manifest.MF" : the search should return no results
