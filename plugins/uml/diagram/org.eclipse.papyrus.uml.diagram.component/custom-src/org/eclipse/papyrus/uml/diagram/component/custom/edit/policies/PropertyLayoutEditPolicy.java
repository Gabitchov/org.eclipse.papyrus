/**
 * This edit policy replaces the GMF generated edit policy for Property used as Part in composite structure diagram.
 * In particular it provides a getCreateCommands that add a ChangeBoundRequest on a created Port
 * in order to locate it at the cursor position.
 * This class inherits from StructuredClassifierLayoutEditPolicy which provides support for a correct placement of
 * port during creation.
 * An example of code generated by GMF can be found in {@link CustomPropertyPartEditPartCN#createLayoutEditPolicy()}.
