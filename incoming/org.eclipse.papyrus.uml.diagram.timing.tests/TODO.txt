remaining tests to write:

- test reordering Lifelines through drag&drop inside the interaction
- test reordering state definitions through drag&drop inside the state definition compartment
- test creating sync/async/reply Messages (check that OccurrenceSpecifications are converted to MessageOccurrenceSpecifications on the fly)
- test deleting a MessageOccurrenceSpecification (check that the associated Message is deleted)
- test creating a lost message
- test moving a lost message floating anchor
- test creating a found message
- test moving a found message floating anchor
- test re-orienting sync/async/reply Messages
- test re-orienting a create message: everything before the start occurrence must be deleted
- test re-orienting a destroy message: everything after the destruction occurrence must be deleted
- test re-orienting the source of a lost message
- test re-orienting the target of a found message
- test creating a Gate on the border of an Interaction
- test renaming a Gate
- test deleting a Gate (the associated Messages must be deleted)
- test re-orienting a message from/to a Gate
- 

- test creating a create message (full and compact): check that occurrences and state invariants before the start occurrence are deleted
- check that time elements and general orderings are not deleted when creating a create message, unless their related element gets deleted
- check that deleting the start occurrence (from a create message) restores the timeline to normal (full and compact): starting with a StateInvariant
- check that deleting the state invariant immediately after a creation occurrence (that starts the timeline) also deletes the creation occurrence

- test creating a delete message: check that a DestructionOccurrenceSpecification is created and that other occurrences and state invariants after it are deleted
- check that time elements and general orderings are not deleted when adding a DestructionOccurrenceSpecification, unless their related element gets deleted
- test creating a DestructionOccurrenceSpecification from the palette
- test deleting a DestructionOccurrenceSpecification

- test creating TimeObservations/TimeConstraints (on occurrence specifications and state invariants)
- test renaming TimeObservations/TimeConstraints
- test deleting TimeObservations/TimeConstraints
- test that changing "firstEvent" on a TimeObservation/TimeConstraint moves the TimeObservation/TimeConstraint
- test that TimeObservations and TimeConstraints have the same horizontal position as the element they are linked to
- test creating DurationObservations/DurationConstraints (on occurrence specifications and state invariants)
- test creating DurationObservation/DurationConstraint from a state invariant to the same state invariant
- test renaming DurationObservations/DurationConstraints
- test deleting DurationObservations/DurationConstraints
- test that a DurationObservation/DurationConstraint on the last StateInvariant is properly positioned
- test that a DurationObservation/DurationConstraint on a StateInvariant is reconnected to the new StateInvariant when cutting the first StateInvariant in two (not yet implemented)
- test that DurationObservations/DurationConstraints have the correct horizontal position and size considering the elements they are linked to
- same thing, on a compact state with occurrences on top of it
- test that in the presence of a DestructionOccurrenceSpecification, DurationObservations/DurationConstraints on the last state end on this DestructionOccurrenceSpecification
- test creating a general ordering
- test renaming a general ordering
- test deleting a general ordering


- test dropping lifelines with their covering fragments
- test dropping messages (sync/async/reply/create/delete/lost/found)
- test dropping TimeObservation, TimeConstraint, DurationObservation, DurationConstraint
- test dropping GeneralOrdering
- test dropping Gate
- test dropping non-valid models (to check that validation fixes the model)

- test stereotypes
- test switching between full and compact lifelines
- test that what works with OccurrenceSpecifications (moving, hiding, deleting, etc.) also works with MessageOccurrenceSpecifications and DestructionOccurrenceSpecifications
