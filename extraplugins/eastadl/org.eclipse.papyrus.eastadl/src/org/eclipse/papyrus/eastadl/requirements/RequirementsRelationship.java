/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Relationship</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * A relation between two or more requirements. Source and target requirements of the relation are distinguished, which means that the relation is
 * directed (from source to target). If such a distinction does not make sense, then use a ReqGroup instead.
 * The standard case will be a relation with one source and one target requirement. However, it is possible to have several source and-or several
 * target requirements so that general n:m relations can be expressed with instances of this class.
 * The semantic of a concrete requirement relation is not defined by the EAST-ADL2 and therefore needs to be provided by the modeler. In particular,
 * three ways are conceivable:
 * 1) The user attributes of the relation can be used to specify its meaning, for example with a user attribute called relationType which is set to
 * values such as needs or excludes.
 * 2) The uaType (user attributeable element type) can be used. Certain types will be used for certain relation semantics.
 * 3) ReqRelationGroups can be used, i.e. all relations with an excludes meaning are put in one relation group and all with a needs meaning are put in
 * another
