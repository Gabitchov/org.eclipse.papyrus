/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc --> A representation of the model object '<em><b>Binding Time</b></em>'. <!--
 * end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * The motivation for attributing features and variable elements with binding times is that binding times encapsulate important information about the
 * variability under view:
 * 
 * Variability that must be bound (determined, decided) very early in the system development may not be visible in one single feature model but only
 * in comparison with different feature models in the context of multi-level feature trees; late bound variability is variability providing the driver
 * with choices for current equipment configuration.
 * 
 * Binding times are important because they describe if the variability must be decided during system development or if the variability is determined
 * by a customer or if the variability itself is part of the product features that are sold to the customer. Possible binding times are:
 * 
 * - SystemDesignTime
 * - CodeGenerationTime
 * - PreCompileTime
 * - LinkTime
 * - PostBuild
 * - Runtime
 * 
 * Note that a binding time is never a particular point in time such as April 2nd, 2011, but always a certain stage in the overall development,
 * production and shipment process as represented by the above values.
 * 
 * Each feature must have a binding time (association requiredBindingTime) and may have one further binding time (association actualBindingTime).
 * 
 * The required binding time describes the binding time that the feature is intended to have. But due to technical conditions it may occur that the
 * actually realized binding time of the feature differs from the originally intended binding time. In this case one has to provide information about
 * the actual binding time. In the rationale it must be described by what the required binding time is motivated and what the reasons are for a
 * (different) actual binding time.
 * 
 * Extension:
 * Class.
