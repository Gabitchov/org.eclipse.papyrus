/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Feature Configuration</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * FeatureConfiguration defines an actual configuration of a FeatureModel, in particular the selection or deselection of optional features, values for
 * selected parameterized features, and instance creations for cloned features.
 * 
 * Note that configurations of feature models are realized as a specialization of metaclass ConfigurationDecisionModel. This is possible because a
 * ConfigurationDecisionModel also captures configuration, i.e. of its target feature model(s) ; while in the standard case of
 * ConfigurationDecisionModel this target-side configuration depends on a given configuration of source feature model(s), we here simply define a
 * "constant" target-side configuration without considering any source configurations. Therefore, the FeatureConfiguration meta-class has additional
 * constraints compared to the super-class ConfigurationDecisionModel: the FeatureConfiguration has no source FeatureModel and only a single target
 * FeatureModel, which serves as the FeatureModel being configured, explicitly defined through association 'configuredFeatureModel'. And since there
 * are no source feature model to which the criterion can refer, all ConfigurationDecisions in a FeatureConfiguration must have "true" as their
 * criterion.
 * 
 * 
 * Semantics:
 * The FeatureConfiguration specifies a concrete configuration of a feature model, in particular which Features of this FeatureModel are selected or
 * deselected.
 * 
 * Extension:
 * Class
 * 
 * Constraint:
 * [1] Attribute criterion of all ConfigurationDecisions in a FeatureConfiguration must be set to "true".
