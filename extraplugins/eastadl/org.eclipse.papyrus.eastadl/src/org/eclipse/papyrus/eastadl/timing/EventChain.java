/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc --> A representation of the model object '<em><b>Event Chain</b></em>'. <!--
 * end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * The purpose of event chains is to describe the temporal behavior of a number of steps to be taken to respond to one or more events accordingly. [An
 * event chain is also used to express that a temporal requirement/constraint is imposed on a number of steps to respond to one or more events
 * accordingly (-> requirement).] Such events could be observed in a given system and are categorized into stimuli and responses.
 * 
 * Event chains can refer to other event chains which are then called event chain segments or strands. Segments are sequential event chains refining
 * an EventChain, while strands define parallel event chains that refine an EventChain. An EventChain can be both a segment and a strand at the same
 * time. An event chain respectively event chain segment can be atomic which means it is not refined to other event chains.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * [1] The cardinality of strand shall be either 0 or greater than 1. Rationale: Only values > 1 express true parallelism.
 * 
 * Semantics:
 * An EventChain references two groups of events: stimulus and response. The semantics is that each event in the stimulus group somehow causes, or at
 * least affects the value of all events in the response group. However, since questions about causality and value influence clearly involve the
 * semantics of the underlying structural model, this aspect of an EventChain is semantically outside its scope. Instead, delay constraint semantics
 * are defined solely in terms of the times at which the stimulus and response events occur, independently of whether there actually exists a causal
 * connection between these events in the structural model.
