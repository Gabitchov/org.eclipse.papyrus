 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * An Event (E) is supposed to denote a distinct form of state change in a running system, taking place at distinct points in time called occurrences
 * of the event. An event may also report a [current] state. In that case, the event occurs periodically. For example, the
 * "driver door has been opened" is an event indicating a state change; whereas the "driver door is open" is an event reporting a state.
 * 
 * A running system can be observed by identifying certain forms of state changes to watch for, and for each such observation point, noting the times
 * when changes occur. This notion of observation also applies to a hypothetical predicted run of a system or a system model from a timing
 * perspective, the only information that needs to be in the output of such a prediction is a sequence of times for each observation point, indicating
 * the times that each event is predicted to occur.
 * 
 * The occurrence of an event either stimulates an execution, or is caused by an execution [as a response to another event that occurred before]. In
 * the first case the event is called Stimulus (S) and in the latter case it is called Response (R). Stimuli always precede responses; and responses
 * in turn always succeed stimuli.
 * 
 * An event occurs instantaneously, which means that an event occurs at a time instant without any duration. In addition, an event can appear any
 * number of times and the subsequent occurrences may follow a specific pattern, like periodic, sporadic, or in sudden bursts. Each of these
 * occurrences has a unique time instant.
 * 
 * The distinction between an event and its occurrence is usually obvious from the considered context (causal and temporal). The event is not defined
 * by its occurrences, but rather by a description expressing its purpose.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * [1] In the case that the event reports a [current] state (isStateChange is FALSE), the event must have a periodic event model [or a pattern model].
 * Rationale: The [current] state shall be reported consistently and periodically.
