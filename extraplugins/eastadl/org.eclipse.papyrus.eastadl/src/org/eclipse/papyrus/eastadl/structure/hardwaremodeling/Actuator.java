/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Actuator</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * The Actuator is the element that represents electrical actuators, such as valves, motors, lamps, brake units, etc. Non-electrical actuators such as
 * the engine, hydraulics, etc. are considered part of the plant model (environment). Plant models are not part of the Hardware Design Architecture.
 * 
 * Semantics:
 * The Actuator metaclass represents the physical and electrical aspects of actuator hardware. The logical aspect is represented by a HWFunctionType
 * associated to the Actuator.
 * 
 * Notation:
 * Actuator is shown as a solid-outline rectangle with double vertical borders. The rectangle contains the name, and its ports or port groups on the
 * perimeter.
