/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Vehicle Level Binding</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * This class represents a ConfigurationDecisionModel on vehicle level with explicitly defined source and target feature models. The source feature
 * models must be on vehicle level, but the target feature models may be located on artifact level, e.g. the public feature model of the top-level
 * FunctionType in the FDA. This way, a VehicleLevelConfigurationDecisionModel may be used to bridge the gap from vehicle level variability management
 * to that on artifact level.
 * 
 * Source feature models may be either the core technical feature model (as defined by association technicalFeatureModel of meta-class VehicleLevel)
 * or one of the optional product feature models (as defined by association productFeatureModel of meta-class Variability in the variability
 * extension).
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * [1] The sourceVehicleFeatureModels shall only contain VehicleFeatures.
 * [2] The sourceVehicleFeatureModels shall be different from the targetFeatureModels
