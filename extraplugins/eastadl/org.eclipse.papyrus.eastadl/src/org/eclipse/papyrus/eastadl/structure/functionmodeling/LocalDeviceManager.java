/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc --> A representation of the model object ' <em><b>Local Device Manager</b></em>'. <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * The LocalDeviceManager represents a DesignFunction that act as a manager or functional interface to Sensors, Actuators and other devices. It is
 * responsible fort translating between the electrical/logical interface of the device, as provided by a BasicSoftwareFunction, and the physical
 * interface of the device. For example, consider a temperature sensor with voltage output. The HardwareFunctionType defines the transfer from
 * temperature to voltage. A BasicSoftwareFunction relays the voltage from the microcontroller’s I/O. The role of the LocalDeviceManager is now to
 * translate from voltage to temperature value, taking into account the sensor’s characteristics such as nonlinearities, calibration, etc. The
 * resulting temperature is available to the other DesignFunctions. By separating the device specific part from the middleware and ECU specific parts,
 * it is possible to systematically change interface function together with the device.
 * 
 * 
 * Semantics:
 * The LocalDeviceManager encapsulates the device-specific or functional parts of a Sensor or, Actuator, device, etc. interface.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * [1] A DesignFunctionPrototype typed by a LocalDeviceManager shall be allocated to the same ECU node as the device that it manages is connected to.
 * 
 * [2] A LocalDeviceManager may only interface either Sensors or Actuators.
 * 
 * [3] A LocalDeviceManager shall interface BSWFunctions and DesignFunctions.
 * 
 * 
 * Extension: Class, specialization of SysML::Block
