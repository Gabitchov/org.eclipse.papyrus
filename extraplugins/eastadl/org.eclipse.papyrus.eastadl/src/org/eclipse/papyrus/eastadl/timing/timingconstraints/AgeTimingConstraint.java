 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Age Timing Constraint</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 * 
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * Different tolerances on over-/undersampling can be identified when the solution has been modeled.
 * 
 * An age constraint is of interest in control engineering when looking back through the system.
 * 
 * In case of over- or undersampling, there is no one-to-one relation possible between the occurrences of stimuli and responses of the associated
 * event chain. Thus, the age constraint defines the semantic of which delay must be constrained.
 * 
 * The attribute upper is applicable in worst-case analysis.
 * 
 * The attribute lower is applicable in best-case analysis.
